My formal education was a winding road revolving around my broad interests in behavioral ecology and wildlife conservation. Along the way, I nurtured an interest in the quantitative side of research. My statistics coursework introduced me to [SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_us/home.html) but a course on using [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) as a research tool became a gateway to [R](https://www.r-project.org), which has been my primary computational tool for nearly 20 years. My work in R primarily centers on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data, but I've also used R for building simulation models and I particularly enjoy building web applications with [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co). My second favorite computational tool is [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/), which I've used for building spatially-explicit, individual-based models of foraging behavior and animal movement. In recent years, I've had fun tinkering with different programming languages and developed a particular fondness for [Chez Scheme](https://cisco.github.io/ChezScheme/) and a growing interest in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org).
